# mcCPPGraph

Recoding of our algorithmic approaches for the multi-criteria Minimum-Spanning-Tree problem (mcMST) and multi-criteria Shortest-Path-Problem in C++.

## Technical details

* We use C++11 standard
* Unit-tests are performed with [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) ([installation instruction for OS X](http://hack.limbicmedia.ca/installing-google-test/))
* May contain some unelegant / not C++-like code, since I am a C++ rookie :)
